## 📈 Project 2 – Regression: Financial Forecasting

### 🔍 Objective
Predict a continuous financial variable (e.g., price, volume) based on market or firm-level features.

### 📂 Dataset
- **Type**: Structured financial data
- **Target Variable**: Continuous (e.g., future stock value)
- **Features**: Economic indicators, historical prices, volumes
- [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/debashis74017/nifty-bank-minute-data?select=NIFTY+BANK+-+1+day_with_indicators_.csv]

### 🔧 Models Used
- Linear Regression
- Lasso Regression
- ElasticNet Regression

### 📊 Evaluation Metrics
- RMSE
- R² Score

### ✅ Outcome
ElasticNet offered the best balance between predictive performance and regularization, reducing overfitting on test data.

## 🖼️ Project 3 – Multiclass Image Classification: Visual Recognition

### 🔍 Objective
Classify images into one of several categories using deep learning.

### 📂 Dataset
- **Type**: Images (e.g., animals, objects, or digits)
- **Format**: JPEG/PNG
- **Labels**: Multiple classes (e.g., 10–100 classes)
- [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sshikamaru/fruit-recognition]

### 🧠 Techniques
- Data Augmentation
- CNN Architecture (e.g., custom or transfer learning)
- Softmax Output for Multiclass Prediction

### 📊 Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy
- Precision/Recall per class
- Confusion Matrix

### ✅ Outcome
Model achieved high classification accuracy using convolutional layers, batch normalization, and regularization. Optimized with cross-entropy loss and early stopping.

## 🔐 Ethical Considerations
- **Bias & Fairness**: Ensuring no demographic bias in classification tasks
- **Privacy**: Handling sensitive financial and image data securely
- **Model Risk**: False negatives in fraud detection can lead to financial loss
- **Monitoring**: Continuous updates needed for evolving fraud/image patterns
